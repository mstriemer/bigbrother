    <h1>Big Brother 13 Rules</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Big Brother 13 pool! Thanks for playing! The object of
    the game is to have the most points at the end of the Big Brother 13
    season.</p>

    <p>You will earn points throughout the season by making correct predictions
    on Head of Household winners, nominations, veto winners and evictions.</p>

    <p>To play in this pool, you have to agree to no 24 hour internet feed, and
    no spoilers. That provides an unfair advantage for predictions in some
    cases. This is the honour system!</p>

    <p>For a correct Head of Household prediction, you will receive 20 points.
    You may pick one player who you believe will win HOH each week. HOH
    predictions must be made before the eviction/HOH episode every week,
    beginning with the second HOH competition.</p>

    <p>For correct nomination predictions, you will receive 10 points. You may
    pick two players who you believe will be nominated for eviction. It is
    possible to receive up to 20 points, one for each correct nomination, per
    week, beginning with the first week’s nominations. If one of your
    predictions becomes a replacement nominee following a POV competition, you
    will still receive the full 10 points for the prediction. Nomination
    predictions must be made before the nomination episode each week. If the
    HOH competition runs over into the nomination episode, everyone will be at
    the same disadvantage with that week’s predictions. Remember, no live feed
    or internet spoilers allowed, so don’t cheat!</p>

    <p>For a correct Power of Veto winner prediction, you will receive 8
    points. You may pick one player who you believe you believe will win POV,
    beginning with the first POV competition. Remember when predicting the
    winner of POV that not all players get to participate in the POV
    competition. This means that you have to not only predict the winner, but
    also who you think will be playing. It is automatic that the two nominated
    houseguests and the current HOH will be playing in every POV competition.
    Power of Veto winner predictions must be in before the POV episode (the
    episode following nominations) every week.</p>

    <p>For a correct eviction prediction, you will receive 5 points. You may
    pick one player who you believe will be evicted, beginning with the first
    week’s eviction. You will have a 50/50 chance of getting the eviction guess
    correct. Your prediction for eviction must be in before the beginning of
    the eviction/HOH episode each week.</p>

    <p>Predicting the winner will work just like predicting an eviction.
    Everyone will have a 50/50 shot at guessing the winner correctly. For a
    correct winner prediction, you will receive 50 points. You may chose one
    player who you believe will win Big Brother 13. Predictions for the winner
    of Big Brother 13 must be in before the beginning of the finale episode.
    There are also big points on the line if the winner of Big Brother 13 is a
    player that you have selected to play on your “team”.</p>

    <p>You will go through the game with four Big Brother houseguests that you
    have selected to play as your “team”. Each time a member of your team wins
    HOH or wins the POV, you will receive half the number of points
    automatically that you would have received for a correct prediction. For
    example, your team has:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Player 1</li>
        <li>Player 2</li>
        <li>Player 3</li>
        <li>Player 4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You have predicted that Player 1 will win this week’s HOH.</p>

    <p>If Player 1 wins the HOH competition, you will receive the 20 points for
    a correct HOH prediction, plus another 10 points because the winner of the
    HOH competition is on your team.</p>

    <p>OR</p>

    <p>You have predicted Player 3 will win HOH.</p>

    <p>If Player 1 wins, you will not receive the points for a correct HOH
    prediction, but you will still receive 10 points (half the value of a
    correct prediction) because the winner of the HOH competition is on your
    team.</p>

    <p>You will not receive automatic points if a player on your team is
    nominated for eviction or is evicted. However, you can predict that someone
    on your team will be nominated or evicted, and if you are correct you will
    receive the corresponding points for a correct prediction.</p>

    <p>You will have until after the second HOH competition of the season to
    finalize your team. You must have your team finalized going into the second
    nomination episode. If the HOH competition carries over to the second
    nomination episode, the deadline for team selection will be pushed back to
    the end of the nomination episode.</p>

    <p>It is important that you pick the strongest four players for your team.
    The more competitions that are won by your team members, and the longer
    they stay in the game, the more points you will receive. If a player on
    your team wins Big Brother 13, you will receive an additional 50 points!
    This means that with a correct winner prediction and the winner on your
    team, you will end the season with an additional 100 points!</p>

    <p>The website will disable predictions corresponding with the start time
    of each episode. If you do not have your predictions in by then, you will
    not be able to make your predictions for that particular competition. You
    will be sent an automatic reminder email 24 hours before your predictions
    are due.</p>

    <p>The website will also allow you to see your total points, and the total
    points of everyone else in the pool. If there is a points discrepancy,
    please contact Emily or Mark at 275-3303. In the event of a disagreement
    over points, the website administrator (Mark) will have the final say. If
    there are any concerns, questions or technical difficulties with the
    website, please contact Mark at <a
        href="mailto:mstriemer@gmail.com">mstriemer@gmail.com</a>. If a technical glitch
    in the site prevents you from making your predictions on time,
    accommodations will be made.</p>

    <p>Thanks for playing and GOOD LUCK!</p>
